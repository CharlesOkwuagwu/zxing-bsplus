<p><strong class="notranslate">Barcode Scanner+ Simple</strong> is not just about <em>receiving</em> information from barcodes out there.
It can also <em>send</em> information, by creating barcodes that others can scan off of your device's screen --
maybe another person with a mobile device like yours. Barcodes can be a convenient way to transfer small
amounts of information between devices.</p>

<h3>Sharing information</h3>

<p>Just press Menu, then choose "Share". On the following screen, you will be able to choose what type of
information you want to share.</p>

<h4>Applications</h4>

<p>For any application on your device, you can generate a barcode that encodes a link into that application's
page in the Android Market. When scanned by another Android device, it will allow the user to quickly download
the application.</p>

<h4>Clipboard</h4>

<p>You can encode what is on the device's clipboard at the moment. This will be disabled if the
clipboard is empty.</p>

<h4>Text</h4>

<p>Finally, you can simply type text into the text field at the bottom of the screen. Press the Enter key
to encode.</p>
