<p><strong class="notranslate">Barcode Scanner+ Simple</strong> stores a history of barcodes you have scanned.
This includes the contents,
time, format, and other related information. You can access the history by pressing the Menu button, and then
selecting History.</p>

<p>You will see a list of previous scans. Press one to recall the details of the scan on the screen, and
act on it just as if it had been scanned again. Long press to clear one item.
You can clear the history by pressing Menu and then selecting "Clear history".</p>

<h3>Copying to the clipboard</h3>

<p>By default, the contents of each scan are copied to the clipboard also. To disable this, deselect
"Copy to clipboard" in Settings.</p>

<h3>Bulk scanning mode</h3>

<p>Some users need to scan many barcodes, in order to store and later export the scan history.
To make this easier, enable "Bulk scan mode" under Settings. After each successful scan, the application
will prepare to read another barcode, instead of displaying the result screen.</p>

<h3>Multiple scans of one barcode</h3>

<p>By default, if a barcode is scanned several times, the history will only record the most recent scan
of that barcode. This can be changed by enabling "Remember duplicates" in Settings. This will cause the
history to record all scans.</p>
